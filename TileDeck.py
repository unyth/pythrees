The next tile given to you is not completely random. It's drawn without
replacement from a shuffled deck with above tiles. When you run out,
another is created. I think this can be implemented in two different
ways without affect the how the game is emulated. One way is to shuffle
a copy of the list and then draw in order. Another is to pop off a
random tile.

    After a certain tile value is achieved on the board, bonus tiles
    start to be added after every 2 stacks. In this version, this
    behavior will be hard coded in. I wonder if the actual game flips a
    coin after every tile deck is used up.

    The highest bonus tile is 1/8 of the current highest tile on the
    board. The smallest bonus tile is 6. When the smallest bonus tile is
    allowed to be created, bonus tiles comes into effect.

    There are a maximum of possible bonus tiles. Their values are 1/8,
    1/16, and 1/32 of the highest tile on the board. Only bonus tile
    value greater than 6 shows up as a possible choice. One of these
    tiles is added to the board like a regular tile after a swipe. It's
    random which one is added.

    We just add the tile to the head of our standard deck. The display
    will handle showing all possible bonus tiles.

    The standard deck are two base decks that are shuffled and then
