# pythrees
Python curses homage to Threes! by Asher Vollmer, Greg Wohlwend, Jimmy Hinson, Hidden Variable for easier development of AI/ML strategies for playing the game.

## Implementation Philosophy
This implementation uses python 2.7. When I started writing pythrees, it was the default python version on a lot of OSes. I have tried to use only the features that exists in the standard library, so that no additional package installation is needed.

The only caveat is that ThreesGame.py uses python curses library. Although it's part of python's standard library, it not available for Windows installations of python.
