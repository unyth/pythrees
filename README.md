# pythrees
Python curses homage to Threes! by Asher Vollmer, Greg Wohlwend, Jimmy Hinson, Hidden Variable for easier development of AI/ML strategies for playing the game.

## Implementation Philosophy
This implementation uses python 2.7. When I started writing pythrees, it was the default python version on a lot of OSes. I have tried to use only the features that exists in the standard library, so that no additional package installation is needed.
